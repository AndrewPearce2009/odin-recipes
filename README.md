Recipes website project for The Odin Project 

This project is to cover practicing the basics of website creation
using HTML fundamentals.

This project will start with just the HTML structure but as the course
progresses the proejct will be revisited and these foundations will
be built upon with CSS and JavaScript.

The recipes used for this project have been obtained from the following
